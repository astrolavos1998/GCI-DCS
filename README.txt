GCI - Ground Controlled Interception.

The GCI simulates a GCI where by taking an “image” from ground and naval radars it gives BRAA separately for each client/player and Coalition.
You can choose how many targets it will give you BRAA for, at what maximum distance, the refresh rate of the BRAA as well as the option to enable/disable the GCI.



WARNING: Use of GCI v.4.3.lua is at your own risk.
